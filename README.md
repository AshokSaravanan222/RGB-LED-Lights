# RGB-LED-Lights

Author: Ashok Saravanan

Created 01-13-2022

Added homekit/alexa implementation to existing RGB-LED Lights (using Arduino). Most of the homekit end of things comes from Mixiaoxiao's project on this:

It is very detailed and is what allowed me to make my own implementation.

I am currently working on a program that can utilize both alexa and homekit into one program.
